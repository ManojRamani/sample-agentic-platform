    "# Advanced Agent Concepts Lab Setup\n",
    "In the next couple labs we'll be exploring some more advanced concepts of agents around model context protocol (MCP), multi-agent-system, and alternative orchestration patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the module we'll be building out a deep research agent using various techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that, we need a way to access the internet and have our agent do searches for us. You could build this from scratch, but there's lots of products out there that do this for you. For our examples, we'll use Tavily. Tavily gives you a very generous free tier which is more than enough for our lab. \n",

    "To use Tavily, you need to setup an account and get an key. \n",
    "1. Go to https://tavily.com/ and create a free account\n",
    "2. Create a .env file in this notebooks/ dir \n",
    "3. Take the tavily key and put it in the env file. \n",
