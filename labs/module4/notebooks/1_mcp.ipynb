    "# Advanced Agents: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Lab\n",
    "Welcome to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) lab! In this hands-on session, you'll learn about MCP - an open protocol released by Anthropic that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MCP?\n",
    "Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of MCP is simple. Create an open standard for how LLMs communicate with tools, resources, and prompts. As you may have noticed, nothing is standardized across generative AI. Different frameworks have different tool definitions, each API provider has a different API definition (even message definition), frameworks all do things differently. It ends up creating a lot of effort to make things all play together nicely. \n",
    "\n",
    "MCP aims to solve at least part of that puzzle. By creating an open specification for how people should define tools, prompts, and resources, we can start making pluggable and reusable agent components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Build\n",
    "In this lab, we will:\n",
    "1. Create an MCP Server hosting our custom tools\n",
    "2. Set up an MCP Client which will consume our tool server\n",
    "3. Integrate with other open source MCP servers\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you'll understand how MCP creates a unified interface for LLMs to access external data and functionality, making your AI applications more modular, maintainable, and interoperable.\n",
    "Let's get started!"

    "# Build an MCP Server\n",
    "MCP servers are simple using the python SDK. Define your tools and add type annotations. Then build and run the server. once started, FastMCP (part of the SDK) will automatically convert your tools into an MCP compatible server that can used by an agent. Servers can either be local (connected over STDIO) or remote (connected over HTTP SSE). They can also be written in different languages. For example, lots of servers are written in Typescript. The ones we'll write here are Python for consistency, but we'll also import 3P servers that are written in a variety of languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two MCP standard APIs we'll be playing with today are list-tools and call-tool. \n",
