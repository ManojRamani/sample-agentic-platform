## Multi-Agent Architecture

This agent implements a multi-agent system with specialized agents:

### Agent Types
- **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates multi-agent interactions using the `coordinate_agents` tool
- **Research Agent**: Specializes in information gathering and analysis
- **Analysis Agent**: Handles mathematical calculations and problem-solving
- **Creative Agent**: Focuses on creative tasks and innovative thinking

### Agent Strategy Determination
The system automatically determines which agents to use based on query keywords:
- **Research keywords**: research, find, search, information, facts, data, study, investigate
- **Analysis keywords**: analyze, calculate, solve, problem, math, statistics, logic, reasoning  
- **Creative keywords**: create, write, story, creative, brainstorm, innovative, design, imagine

## Key Differences from Other Agents

### Endpoints
- **Health**: `/health` (no authentication required)
- **Invoke**: `/invoke` (authentication required) - Uses `/multi-agent-chat` path prefix
- **Streaming**: `/stream` (authentication required) - Uses `/multi-agent-chat` path prefix

### Port Forwarding
- Uses port **8004** (unique port for this agent)
- Maps to service port 80: `localhost:8004 -> service:80`

### Authentication
- **Health endpoint**: No authentication required
- **Chat endpoints**: M2M token authentication required
- **Token source**: AWS Secrets Manager with predefined secret ARN

### Multi-Agent Features
- **Agent coordination**: Uses specialized tools for agent collaboration
- **Strategy-based routing**: Automatically selects appropriate agents based on query content
- **Enhanced metadata**: Response includes agent strategy and available agents information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **kubectl not configured**: Ensure your kubeconfig points to the correct EKS cluster
- **Service not found**: Verify the `my-new-multi-agent-chat` service is deployed
- **Authentication failures**: Check AWS credentials and Secrets Manager access
- **Port forwarding issues**: The test automatically manages port forwarding to localhost:8004
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Check that all agent types are properly initialized

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check EKS connection
kubectl cluster-info

# Check service status
kubectl get service my-new-multi-agent-chat

# Check pod status  
kubectl get pods -l app=my-new-multi-agent-chat

# View service logs
kubectl logs -l app=my-new-multi-agent-chat --tail=20

# Check ingress path
kubectl get ingress -o yaml | grep -A5 -B5 multi-agent-chat
```

## Architecture

The test uses **port forwarding** to securely access the EKS service:
```
Test â†’ kubectl port-forward â†’ EKS Service â†’ Multi-Agent Chat Pods
```

This approach:
- âœ… Works with private EKS clusters
- âœ… Doesn't require LoadBalancer or Ingress setup
- âœ… Uses secure kubectl authentication
- âœ… Tests the actual deployed multi-agent service (not mocks)

## Authentication Flow

    participant Test as Test Runner
    participant SM as AWS Secrets Manager
    participant Cognito as AWS Cognito
    participant Service as Multi-Agent Chat Service
    
    Test->>SM: Get M2M credentials
    SM->>Test: Return client_id, client_secret, token_url
    Test->>Cognito: Request access token
    Cognito->>Test: Return JWT access token
    Test->>Service: API calls with Bearer token
    Service->>Test: Multi-agent responses
```

## Multi-Agent Flow

    participant Client as Test Client
    participant Coordinator as Coordinator Agent
    participant Research as Research Agent
    participant Analysis as Analysis Agent
    participant Creative as Creative Agent
    
    Client->>Coordinator: "Calculate 15 * 8 and explain"
    Coordinator->>Coordinator: Determine strategy (analysis)
    Coordinator->>Analysis: Delegate calculation task
    Analysis->>Analysis: Perform calculation
    Analysis->>Coordinator: Return result (120)
    Coordinator->>Client: Enhanced response with explanation
```

## Service Configuration

The test expects the following Kubernetes resources:
- **Service**: `my-new-multi-agent-chat` with selector `app=my-new-multi-agent-chat`
- **Pods**: Running pods with label `app=my-new-multi-agent-chat`
- **Port**: Service running on port 80
- **Health**: Service responds to `/health` endpoint
- **Authentication**: Service validates JWT tokens for `/invoke` and `/stream` endpoints
- **Ingress**: Service accessible via `/multi-agent-chat` path
- **Multi-Agent**: Service implements multi-agent coordination and strategy determination

## Expected Response Patterns

### Analysis Tasks
For mathematical queries, expect responses containing:
- Numerical results (e.g., "120")
- Keywords: "calculation", "multiply", "result", "analysis"
- Strategy metadata indicating analysis agent usage

### Creative Tasks  
For creative queries, expect responses containing:
- Creative content and storytelling
- Keywords: "story", "creative", "imagine"
- Strategy metadata indicating creative agent usage

### Research Tasks
For information queries, expect responses containing:
- Structured information and analysis
- Keywords: "research", "information", "facts"
- Strategy metadata indicating research agent usage
